# AI-Powered Video Text Inpainting System

An intelligent video processing service that automatically removes text overlays from videos using advanced AI algorithms, built during my role at [MetaFrazo](https://www.metafrazo.ai/).

## Overview

This project involved building a comprehensive AI-powered video text-inpainting service that processes videos to remove unwanted text overlays while maintaining visual quality. The system serves 500+ users across different subscription tiers with high reliability and performance.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 92%+ text removal accuracy using GhostCut API integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced job runtime by 30% through parallel processing with Celery
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with FastAPI for high-performance async processing
- **Multi-tier Access**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized pipeline with Redis and PostgreSQL

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI for RESTful API development
- **Task Queue**: Celery for distributed task processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching
- **AI Integration**: GhostCut API for advanced text inpainting
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with tiered billing system

### Performance Metrics
- **Text Removal Accuracy**: 92%+
- **Runtime Reduction**: 30% improvement through parallel processing
- **Throughput Increase**: 3.2x boost in task processing
- **Failure Rate**: Reduced to 45% under load
- **User Base**: 500+ active users across Free, Pro, and Enterprise plans

## Key Achievements

1. **Scalable API Development**: Developed 20+ RESTful APIs with comprehensive authentication and billing systems
2. **Infrastructure Optimization**: Leveraged Redis and PostgreSQL to create an optimized async video processing pipeline
3. **DevOps Excellence**: Automated containerized deployment using Docker and Shell scripts
4. **Performance Improvement**: Improved service recovery latency from 20s to under 8s

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Celery
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **APIs**: GhostCut AI API
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **DevOps**: Shell scripting, Container orchestration
