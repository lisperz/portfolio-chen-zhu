# Z-TikTok: Scalable Social Media Platform

A comprehensive social media platform inspired by TikTok, built from the ground up using modern microservices architecture and distributed systems principles.

## Overview

Z-TikTok is a full-featured social media platform that supports video sharing, real-time chat, user interactions, and scalable backend services. The project demonstrates expertise in building high-performance, distributed systems capable of handling thousands of concurrent users.

## Key Features

- **Video Platform**: Complete video upload, processing, and streaming capabilities
- **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging with chat features
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user profiles and authentication
- **Social Features**: Like, comment, follow, and content discovery
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices-based design for horizontal scaling

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Go with high-performance HTTP servers
- **Database**: MySQL for relational data, Redis for caching and sessions
- **Message Queue**: NSQ for distributed messaging
- **Search Engine**: Consul for service discovery
- **Logging**: Jaeger for distributed tracing

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for service isolation
- **Data Storage**: Scalable file storage for video content
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching with Redis and MinIO
- **Load Balancing**: Distributed traffic management

## Performance Metrics

- **Daily Active Users**: 20,000+ DAUs supported
- **Concurrent Users**: Optimized for high concurrency
- **Server Load**: 20% decrease during peak traffic through RPC optimization
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of video uploads and streaming
- **Response Time**: Optimized for real-time user interactions

## Key Achievements

1. **High Scalability**: Successfully deployed functional TikTok backend supporting 20,000+ DAUs
2. **Performance Optimization**: Deployed RPC services in clustered environment with Consul load balancing
3. **System Reliability**: Achieved 20% decrease in server load during peak traffic
4. **Microservices Design**: Implemented scalable, maintainable service architecture
5. **Technology Integration**: Seamlessly integrated multiple technologies for optimal performance

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Databases**: MySQL, Redis, NSQ
- **Storage**: MinIO for object storage
- **Service Discovery**: Consul
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Monitoring**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Architecture**: Microservices, RPC

## System Architecture

### Microservices Components
- **User Service**: Authentication and user management
- **Video Service**: Video upload, processing, and streaming
- **Chat Service**: Real-time messaging functionality
- **Social Service**: Follow, like, comment interactions
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and load balancing

### Data Flow
1. **Content Upload**: Videos processed and stored in MinIO clusters
2. **User Authentication**: JWT-based auth with Redis session management
3. **Real-time Features**: NSQ messaging for instant notifications
4. **Data Caching**: Multi-tier caching strategy for optimal performance

## Scalability Features

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Microservices can be scaled independently
- **Load Distribution**: Consul-based service discovery and load balancing
- **Data Partitioning**: Efficient data distribution across multiple nodes
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching reduces database load
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better performance
